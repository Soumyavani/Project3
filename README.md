Cutting â€“Edge Phishing Detection:Harnessing Ensemble ML for Real-Time Threat Prevention
Current phishing detection methods struggle against sophisticated attacks that use indistinguishable URLs and content, compounded by imbalanced datasets. This project proposes a hybrid model that combines traditional machine learning with advanced natural language processing and behavioral analysis. By integrating multiple data sources and contextual insights, the model aims to enhance detection accuracy, improve real-time response, and effectively address both known and zero-day phishing threats, ultimately optimizing resource use while ensuring robust protection.
